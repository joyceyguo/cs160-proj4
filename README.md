# Wall of Gratitude (CS160 su'21 project 4)

Developers: Joyce Guo @joyceyguo, Vanshikha Sinha @vanshikha-s

This repo contains both the server and the client for a simple platform for sharing appreciation. The platform is designed and developed as a submission for CS160 Summer 2021 Project 4.

## First Time Setup

You would need to install some dev tools and packages.
After cloning the repository, run:

```bash
yarn install
```

If you run into issues when starting the app, additionally run:

```bash
npm install
```

Then you can start the server and the client in two separate terminals.
To start the server, run:

```bash
node server.js
```

To start the create react app client, in a separate terminal, run:

```bash
yarn start
```

## App Navigation

You will see the app deployed on `http://localhost:3000/`.

Version A takes you to: `http://localhost:3000/submit`.

Version B takes you to: `http://localhost:3000/anonsubmit`.

The shared display board is located at: `http://localhost:3000/display`.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
